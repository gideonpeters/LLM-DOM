        "
            1. First Contentful Paint: First Contentful Paint marks the time at which the first text or image is painted. [Learn more about the First Contentful Paint metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/first-contentful-paint/).
 

            
            2. Largest Contentful Paint: Largest Contentful Paint marks the time at which the largest text or image is painted. [Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/)
 

            
            3. Speed Index: Speed Index shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated. [Learn more about the Speed Index metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/speed-index/).
 

            
            4. Total Blocking Time: Sum of all time periods between FCP and Time to Interactive, when task length exceeded 50ms, expressed in milliseconds. [Learn more about the Total Blocking Time metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/).
 

            
            5. Max Potential First Input Delay: The maximum potential First Input Delay that your users could experience is the duration of the longest task. [Learn more about the Maximum Potential First Input Delay metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-max-potential-fid/).
 

            
            6. Time to Interactive: Time to Interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive. [Learn more about the Time to Interactive metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/).
 

            
            7. Minimize main-thread work: Consider reducing the time spent parsing, compiling and executing JS. You may find delivering smaller JS payloads helps with this. [Learn how to minimize main-thread work](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/mainthread-work-breakdown/)
 

            
            8. Reduce JavaScript execution time: Consider reducing the time spent parsing, compiling, and executing JS. You may find delivering smaller JS payloads helps with this. [Learn how to reduce Javascript execution time](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/bootup-time/).
 

            
            9. Preconnect to required origins: Consider adding `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins. [Learn how to preconnect to required origins](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-rel-preconnect/).
 

            
            10. Ensure text remains visible during webfont load: Leverage the `font-display` CSS feature to ensure text is user-visible while webfonts are loading. [Learn more about `font-display`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/font-display/).
 

            
            11. Reduce the impact of third-party code: Third-party code can significantly impact load performance. Limit the number of redundant third-party providers and try to load third-party code after your page has primarily finished loading. [Learn how to minimize third-party impact](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript/).
 

            
            12. Largest Contentful Paint element: This is the largest contentful element painted within the viewport. [Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint element](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/)
 

            
            13. Missing source maps for large first-party JavaScript: Source maps translate minified code to the original source code. This helps developers debug in production. In addition, Lighthouse is able to provide further insights. Consider deploying source maps to take advantage of these benefits. [Learn more about source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/source-maps/).
 

            
            14. `[user-scalable="no"]` is used in the `<meta name="viewport">` element or the `[maximum-scale]` attribute is less than 5.: Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. [Learn more about the viewport meta tag](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/meta-viewport).
 

            
            15. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy: A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. [Learn more about efficient cache policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-long-cache-ttl/).
 

            
            16. Defer offscreen images: Consider lazy-loading offscreen and hidden images after all critical resources have finished loading to lower time to interactive. [Learn how to defer offscreen images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/offscreen-images/).
 

            
            17. Eliminate render-blocking resources: Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. [Learn how to eliminate render-blocking resources](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/render-blocking-resources/).
 

            
            18. Minify JavaScript: Minifying JavaScript files can reduce payload sizes and script parse time. [Learn how to minify JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unminified-javascript/).
 

            
            19. Reduce unused CSS: Reduce unused rules from stylesheets and defer CSS not used for above-the-fold content to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. [Learn how to reduce unused CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-css-rules/).
 

            
            20. Reduce unused JavaScript: Reduce unused JavaScript and defer loading scripts until they are required to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. [Learn how to reduce unused JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/).
 

            
            21. Enable text compression: Text-based resources should be served with compression (gzip, deflate or brotli) to minimize total network bytes. [Learn more about text compression](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression/).
 

            
            22. Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers: Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. For your bundled JavaScript, adopt a modern script deployment strategy using module/nomodule feature detection to reduce the amount of code shipped to modern browsers, while retaining support for legacy browsers. [Learn how to use modern JavaScript](https://web.dev/articles/publish-modern-javascript)
 

            
            23. Issues were logged in the `Issues` panel in Chrome Devtools: Issues logged to the `Issues` panel in Chrome Devtools indicate unresolved problems. They can come from network request failures, insufficient security controls, and other browser concerns. Open up the Issues panel in Chrome DevTools for more details on each issue.
 

            
            24. Document doesn't use legible font sizes: Font sizes less than 12px are too small to be legible and require mobile visitors to “pinch to zoom” in order to read. Strive to have >60% of page text ≥12px. [Learn more about legible font sizes](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/seo/font-size/).
 

            
            25. Links do not have descriptive text: Descriptive link text helps search engines understand your content. [Learn how to make links more accessible](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/seo/link-text/).

        __________________

        Due to the huge token size of HTML files, 
        You are given the HTML in chunks. 
        Please modify this HTML code chunk to resolve the performance issues given above.:

        1. Return the modified HTML code alone, making only necessary changes for performance optimization.
        2. If no optimizations are possible, return the original code.
        3. Do not modify class names
        4. If any optimizations are made, return `<!-- Optimized by LLM -->` at the beginning point of only the changed portion
           and `<!-- End of Optimization -->` at the end of the changed portion.
        5. If the change is within a `<style>` tag, replace the HTML comment with a CSS comment.
        6. Because the code is split into chunks, there might be some unclosed or cut elements, do not worry about that.
        7. Do not change any styles or functionalities of the code.
        8. Consider that a chunk might be a part of a larger element, so the code might not be complete.
        9. Consider that HTML as a whole is from production and might be minified, uglified or compressed.

        The original HTML code is as follows:

        ```html
        
<script>
</script>
<script src="https://assets.nflxext.com/web/ffe/wp/./ui/login/client.e9908a16c0917b39fa99.js">
</script>
</div>
<script>
   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator && navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
        if (registrations) {
            registrations.forEach(function (registration) {
                registration.unregister().catch(function () {});
            });
        }
    }).catch(function () {});
}
  </script>

        ```
