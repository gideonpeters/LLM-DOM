        You are a web performance expert. 
        Based on the following Lighthouse audit issues: 
       
        __________________
        "
            1. Does not have a `<meta name="viewport">` tag with `width` or `initial-scale`: A `<meta name="viewport">` not only optimizes your app for mobile screen sizes, but also prevents [a 300 millisecond delay to user input](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away/). [Learn more about using the viewport meta tag](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/pwa/viewport/).
 

            
            2. First Contentful Paint: First Contentful Paint marks the time at which the first text or image is painted. [Learn more about the First Contentful Paint metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/first-contentful-paint/).
 

            
            3. Largest Contentful Paint: Largest Contentful Paint marks the time at which the largest text or image is painted. [Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/)
 

            
            4. Speed Index: Speed Index shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated. [Learn more about the Speed Index metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/speed-index/).
 

            
            5. Total Blocking Time: Sum of all time periods between FCP and Time to Interactive, when task length exceeded 50ms, expressed in milliseconds. [Learn more about the Total Blocking Time metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/).
 

            
            6. Max Potential First Input Delay: The maximum potential First Input Delay that your users could experience is the duration of the longest task. [Learn more about the Maximum Potential First Input Delay metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-max-potential-fid/).
 

            
            7. Browser errors were logged to the console: Errors logged to the console indicate unresolved problems. They can come from network request failures and other browser concerns. [Learn more about this errors in console diagnostic audit](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/errors-in-console/)
 

            
            8. Time to Interactive: Time to Interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive. [Learn more about the Time to Interactive metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/).
 

            
            9. Uses deprecated APIs: Deprecated APIs will eventually be removed from the browser. [Learn more about deprecated APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/deprecations/).
 

            
            10. Largest Contentful Paint element: This is the largest contentful element painted within the viewport. [Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint element](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/)
 

            
            11. Image elements do not have explicit `width` and `height`: Set an explicit width and height on image elements to reduce layout shifts and improve CLS. [Learn how to set image dimensions](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-cls#images_without_dimensions)
 

            
            12. Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.: Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. [Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/color-contrast).
 

            
            13. Touch targets do not have sufficient size or spacing.: Touch targets with sufficient size and spacing help users who may have difficulty targeting small controls to activate the targets. [Learn more about touch targets](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/target-size).
 

            
            14. Eliminate render-blocking resources: Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. [Learn how to eliminate render-blocking resources](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/render-blocking-resources/).
 

            
            15. Reduce unused JavaScript: Reduce unused JavaScript and defer loading scripts until they are required to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. [Learn how to reduce unused JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/).
 

            
            16. Enable text compression: Text-based resources should be served with compression (gzip, deflate or brotli) to minimize total network bytes. [Learn more about text compression](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression/).
 

            
            17. Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers: Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. For your bundled JavaScript, adopt a modern script deployment strategy using module/nomodule feature detection to reduce the amount of code shipped to modern browsers, while retaining support for legacy browsers. [Learn how to use modern JavaScript](https://web.dev/articles/publish-modern-javascript)
 

            
            18. Document doesn't use legible font sizes: Font sizes less than 12px are too small to be legible and require mobile visitors to “pinch to zoom” in order to read. Strive to have >60% of page text ≥12px. [Learn more about legible font sizes](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/seo/font-size/).

        Due to the huge token size of HTML files, 
        You are given the HTML in chunks, one at a time. 
        Please modify each HTML code chunk to resolve the performance issues given above.

        Make sure you:
        1. Remember the code is split into chunks and you are only receiving one chunk at a time, there might be some unclosed or cut elements, do not worry about that.
        2. Consider that a chunk might be a part of a larger element, so the code might not be complete.
        3. Consider that the HTML as a whole is from production and might be minified, uglified or compressed.
        4. Do not modify class names
        5. DO NOT remove any comments already in the code.
        6. DO NOT change any styles or functionalities of the code.
        7. DO NOT change the structure of the code.
        8. DO NOT change the order of the code.
        9. DO NOT remove critical elements.
        10. If any optimizations are made, return `<!-- Optimized by LLM -->` at the beginning point of only the changed portion
           and `<!-- End of Optimization: {one line short description of elements/things fixed} -->` at the end of the changed portion. Do not indicate any fix outside of the End of Optimization comment.
        11. Return the modified HTML code alone, making only necessary changes for performance optimization.
        12. If no optimizations are possible, return the original code.
        13. Never add any additional comments to the code besides that of the instruction in #7.
        14. If the change is within a `<style>` tag, replace the HTML comment with a CSS comment.

        The original HTML code is as follows:
