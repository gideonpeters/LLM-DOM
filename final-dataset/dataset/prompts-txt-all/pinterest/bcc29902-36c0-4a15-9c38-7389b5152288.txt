[Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint element](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/)
 

            
            16. target-size => Touch targets do not have sufficient size or spacing.: Touch targets with sufficient size and spacing help users who may have difficulty targeting small controls to activate the targets. [Learn more about touch targets](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/target-size).
 

            
            17. uses-long-cache-ttl => Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy: A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. [Learn more about efficient cache policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-long-cache-ttl/).
 

            
            18. total-byte-weight => Avoid enormous network payloads: Large network payloads cost users real money and are highly correlated with long load times. [Learn how to reduce payload sizes](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/total-byte-weight/).
 

            
            19. offscreen-images => Defer offscreen images: Consider lazy-loading offscreen and hidden images after all critical resources have finished loading to lower time to interactive. [Learn how to defer offscreen images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/offscreen-images/).
 

            
            20. unused-css-rules => Reduce unused CSS: Reduce unused rules from stylesheets and defer CSS not used for above-the-fold content to decrease bytes consumed by network activity.

[Learn how to reduce unused JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/).
 

            
            22. modern-image-formats => Serve images in next-gen formats: Image formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption. [Learn more about modern image formats](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-webp-images/).
 

            
            23. uses-optimized-images => Efficiently encode images: Optimized images load faster and consume less cellular data. [Learn how to efficiently encode images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-optimized-images/).
 

            
            24. uses-text-compression => Enable text compression: Text-based resources should be served with compression (gzip, deflate or brotli) to minimize total network bytes. [Learn more about text compression](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression/).
 

            
            25. uses-responsive-images => Properly size images: Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time. [Learn how to size images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-responsive-images/).
 

            
            26. legacy-javascript => Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers: Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. For your bundled JavaScript, adopt a modern script deployment strategy using module/nomodule feature detection to reduce the amount of code shipped to modern browsers, while retaining support for legacy browsers. [Learn how to use modern JavaScript](https://web.dev/articles/publish-modern-javascript)
 

            
            27. dom-size => Avoid an excessive DOM size: A large DOM will increase memory usage, cause longer [style calculations](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations), and produce costly [layout reflows](https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/reflow). [Learn how to avoid an excessive DOM size](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/dom-size/).
 

            
            28. uses-passive-event-listeners => Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance: Consider marking your touch and wheel event listeners as `passive` to improve your page's scroll performance. [Learn more about adopting passive event listeners](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/uses-passive-event-listeners/).

        __________________

        Due to the huge token size of HTML files, 
        You are given the HTML in chunks, one at a time. 
        Please modify each HTML code chunk to resolve the performance issues given above.

        Make sure you:
        1. Remember the code is split into chunks and you are only receiving one chunk at a time, there might be some unclosed or cut elements, do not worry about that.
        2. Consider that a chunk might be a part of a larger element, so the code might not be complete.
        3. Consider that the HTML as a whole is from production and might be minified, uglified or compressed.
        4. DO NOT modify class names
        5. DO NOT remove any comments already in the code.
        6. DO NOT change any styles or functionalities of the code.
        7. DO NOT change the structure of the code.
        8. DO NOT change the order of the code.
        9. DO NOT remove critical elements.
        10. If any optimizations are made, return `<!-- Optimized by LLM -->` at the beginning point of only the changed portion
           and `<!-- End of Optimization: {audit_key of issue being resolved} => {one line short description of elements/things resolved} -->` at the end of the changed portion. 
           Do not indicate any resolution outside of the End of Optimization comment, where there are multiple resolutions being made, seperate them with commas within the End of optimization comment.
        11. Return the modified HTML code alone, making only necessary changes for performance optimization.
        12. If no optimizations are possible, return the original code.
        13. Never add any additional comments to the code besides that of the instruction in #7.
        14. If the change is within a `<style>` tag, replace the HTML comment with a CSS comment.

        The original HTML code is as follows:

        ```html
