            7. interactive => Time to Interactive: Time to Interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive. [Learn more about the Time to Interactive metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/).
 

            
            8. redirects => Avoid multiple page redirects: Redirects introduce additional delays before the page can be loaded. [Learn how to avoid page redirects](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/redirects/).

            10. mainthread-work-breakdown => Minimizes main-thread work: Consider reducing the time spent parsing, compiling and executing JS. You may find delivering smaller JS payloads helps with this. [Learn how to minimize main-thread work](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/mainthread-work-breakdown/)
 

            
            11. bootup-time => JavaScript execution time: Consider reducing the time spent parsing, compiling, and executing JS. You may find delivering smaller JS payloads helps with this.

            15. third-party-summary => Minimize third-party usage: Third-party code can significantly impact load performance. Limit the number of redundant third-party providers and try to load third-party code after your page has primarily finished loading. [Learn how to minimize third-party impact](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript/).
 

            
            16. third-party-facades => Lazy load third-party resources with facades: Some third-party embeds can be lazy loaded. Consider replacing them with a facade until they are required. [Learn how to defer third-parties with a facade](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/third-party-facades/).
 

            
            17. largest-contentful-paint-element => Largest Contentful Paint element: This is the largest contentful element painted within the viewport.

            18. long-tasks => Avoid long main-thread tasks: Lists the longest tasks on the main thread, useful for identifying worst contributors to input delay. [Learn how to avoid long main-thread tasks](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-long-tasks)
 

            
            19. color-contrast => Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.: Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. [Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/color-contrast).
 

            
            20. meta-viewport => `[user-scalable="no"]` is used in the `<meta name="viewport">` element or the `[maximum-scale]` attribute is less than 5.: Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. [Learn more about the viewport meta tag](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/meta-viewport).
 

            
            21. target-size => Touch targets do not have sufficient size or spacing.: Touch targets with sufficient size and spacing help users who may have difficulty targeting small controls to activate the targets. [Learn more about touch targets](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/target-size).
 

            
            22. unused-javascript => Reduce unused JavaScript: Reduce unused JavaScript and defer loading scripts until they are required to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. [Learn how to reduce unused JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/).
 

            
            23. legacy-javascript => Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers: Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. For your bundled JavaScript, adopt a modern script deployment strategy using module/nomodule feature detection to reduce the amount of code shipped to modern browsers, while retaining support for legacy browsers. [Learn how to use modern JavaScript](https://web.dev/articles/publish-modern-javascript)
 

            
            24. inspector-issues => Issues were logged in the `Issues` panel in Chrome Devtools: Issues logged to the `Issues` panel in Chrome Devtools indicate unresolved problems. They can come from network request failures, insufficient security controls, and other browser concerns. Open up the Issues panel in Chrome DevTools for more details on each issue.
 

            
            25. is-crawlable => Page is blocked from indexing: Search engines are unable to include your pages in search results if they don't have permission to crawl them. [Learn more about crawler directives](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/seo/is-crawlable/).

        __________________

        Due to the huge token size of HTML files, 
        You are given the HTML in chunks, one at a time. 
        Please modify each HTML code chunk to resolve the performance issues given above.

        Make sure you:
        1. Remember the code is split into chunks and you are only receiving one chunk at a time, there might be some unclosed or cut elements, do not worry about that.
        2. Consider that a chunk might be a part of a larger element, so the code might not be complete.
        3. Consider that the HTML as a whole is from production and might be minified, uglified or compressed.
        4. DO NOT modify class names
        5. DO NOT remove any comments already in the code.
        6. DO NOT change any styles or functionalities of the code.
        7. DO NOT change the structure of the code.
        8. DO NOT change the order of the code.
        9. DO NOT remove critical elements.
        10. If any optimizations are made, return `<!-- Optimized by LLM -->` at the beginning point of only the changed portion
           and `<!-- End of Optimization: {audit_key of issue being resolved} => {one line short description of elements/things resolved} -->` at the end of the changed portion. 
           Do not indicate any resolution outside of the End of Optimization comment, where there are multiple resolutions being made, seperate them with commas within the End of optimization comment.
        11. Return the modified HTML code alone, making only necessary changes for performance optimization.
        12. If no optimizations are possible, return the original code.
        13. Never add any additional comments to the code besides that of the instruction in #7.
        14. If the change is within a `<style>` tag, replace the HTML comment with a CSS comment.

        The original HTML code is as follows:

        ```html
        

        ```
