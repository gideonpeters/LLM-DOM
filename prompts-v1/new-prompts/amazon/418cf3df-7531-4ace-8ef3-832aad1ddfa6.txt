        Based on the following Lighthouse audit issues:

            1. Largest Contentful Paint: Largest Contentful Paint marks the time at which the largest text or image is painted. [Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/)
 

            
            2. Serves images with low resolution: Image natural dimensions should be proportional to the display size and the pixel ratio to maximize image clarity. [Learn how to provide responsive images](https://web.dev/articles/serve-responsive-images).
 

            
            3. Image elements do not have explicit `width` and `height`: Set an explicit width and height on image elements to reduce layout shifts and improve CLS. [Learn how to set image dimensions](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-cls#images_without_dimensions)
 

            
            4. `<html>` element does not have a `[lang]` attribute: If a page doesn't specify a `lang` attribute, a screen reader assumes that the page is in the default language that the user chose when setting up the screen reader. If the page isn't actually in the default language, then the screen reader might not announce the page's text correctly. [Learn more about the `lang` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/html-has-lang).
 

            
            5. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy: A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. [Learn more about efficient cache policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-long-cache-ttl/).
 

            
            6. Serve images in next-gen formats: Image formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption. [Learn more about modern image formats](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-webp-images/).
 

            
            7. Enable text compression: Text-based resources should be served with compression (gzip, deflate or brotli) to minimize total network bytes. [Learn more about text compression](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression/).
 

            
            8. Document does not have a meta description: Meta descriptions may be included in search results to concisely summarize page content. [Learn more about the meta description](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/seo/meta-description/).

        Due to the huge token size of HTML files, 
        You are given the HTML in chunks. 
        Please modify this HTML code chunk to resolve the performance issues given above.:

        1. Return the modified HTML code alone, making only necessary changes for performance optimization.
        2. If no optimizations are possible, return the original code.
        3. Do not modify class names
        4. If any optimizations are made, return `<!-- Optimized by LLM -->` at the beginning point of only the changed portion
           and `<!-- End of Optimization -->` at the end of the changed portion.
        5. If the change is within a `<style>` tag, replace the HTML comment with a CSS comment.
        6. Because the code is split into chunks, there might be some unclosed or cut elements, do not worry about that.
        7. Do not change any styles or functionalities of the code.
        8. Consider that a chunk might be a part of a larger element, so the code might not be complete.
        9. Consider that HTML as a whole is from production and might be minified, uglified or compressed.

        The original HTML code is as follows:

        ```html
        
<meta charset="utf-8"></meta>
<meta content="ie=edge" http-equiv="x-ua-compatible"></meta>
<meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no" name="viewport"></meta>

   Sorry! Something went wrong!
